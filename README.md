# TitanicKaggleCompetition
Notebook with my code for the titanic competition on kaggle

The notebook contains a handwritten model, using an Adam optimizer (also handwritten) using only numpy.

The model is very versatile, and it permits changes to all of the hyperparameters. 

It also uses L2 regularization, if that's needed. More details are found in the notebook's comments!
